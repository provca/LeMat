# Can You Outsmart Probability?

Imagine you're on a game show. You must choose one of three doors. Behind one is a prize, and behind the other two, nothing. 

1. Pick a door.
2. The host reveals an empty door.
3. Decide: stick with your choice or switch?

Will you trust your instincts or the odds? Play multiple rounds, analyze statistics, and you might be surprised by what the winning strategy could be the best.
