# Schrödinger's Cat Quantum Experiment 🐱🎩

Welcome to the **Schrödinger's Cat Quantum Experiment**! 

Imagine a closed box containing a cat in a mysterious quantum state: **simultaneously alive and dead**. Only by observing the box will this state "collapse" into a definitive reality—either the cat is alive 🐾 or dead 🪦.

## Are you ready to open the box and uncover the cat's fate? 🕵️‍♂️🔍

### What You Can Do:
- **Observe**: Collapse the quantum state and reveal the cat's condition.
- **Check the Wave**: See the probability of the cat being alive or dead without collapsing the state.
- **Restart**: Begin a new experiment if you'd like to try again.
- **Quit**: Exit the experiment anytime.

### How It Works:

1. **Observe**: Type `O` to open the box and reveal the cat's state.
2. **Check Wave State**: Type `S` to view the current probability of the cat being alive or dead without collapsing its state.
3. **Restart**: After observing, restart the experiment to reset the quantum state.
4. **Quit**: Type `Q` to exit the experiment.

### Important Notes:
- Before observation, the cat exists in a **quantum superposition**—both alive and dead, like a wave.
- Observation collapses this state into a definitive reality, akin to a particle's behavior.
