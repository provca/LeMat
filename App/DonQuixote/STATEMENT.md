🌪️ "The Madness of Logic"
Like Don Quixote tilting at windmills, this C# algorithm valiantly battles a paradox it cannot defeat.

⚔️ It claims the opposite of its own truth, chasing an answer that leads only to a logical collapse—a stack overflow.

🌀 What does this mean? Perhaps some questions are not meant to be answered...

"Alas! The logic crumbles beneath its own weight. What is truth, if not a fleeting mirage?"
