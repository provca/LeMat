# The Quixotic Paradox
A whimsical C# program inspired by [Don Quixote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote), exploring the beauty and chaos of paradoxical logic through infinite recursion. This project uses a ``StackOverflowException`` to poetically illustrate the collapse of logic under its own contradictions.

## OverviewOverview
This project delves into recursion, paradoxes, and literary reflection:

1. **Logic Simulation:** A recursive function (DonQuixoteLogic) contradicts itself indefinitely, creating a logical paradox.
2. **StackOverflowException:** The program intentionally triggers a stack overflow, then gracefully handles it with a philosophical message.
3. **Philosophical Humor:** Console messages blend technical outcomes with literary reflections, capturing the essence of Don Quixote's idealism and madness.

## How It Works
1. The function DonQuixoteLogic:
  - Calls itself recursively, flipping the result with !DonQuixoteLogic().
  - Includes a depth limit to simulate recursion safely, avoiding system crashes.

2. Exception Handling:
  - When the recursion reaches the predefined depth (maxDepth), a StackOverflowException is thrown.
  - The program catches this exception and displays a poetic message.

3. Console Output:
  - Prints thoughtful or humorous reflections, like:
    - *"Is the proposition true?"*
    - *"Alas! The logic crumbles beneath its own weight. What is truth, if not a fleeting mirage?"*

## Main Code
```cs
bool DonQuixoteLogic()
{
    return !DonQuixoteLogic();
}

try
{
    Console.WriteLine("Is the proposition true? " + DonQuixoteLogic());
}
catch (StackOverflowException)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Alas! The logic crumbles beneath its own weight. What is truth, if not a fleeting mirage?");
}
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in any C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Compile and run the program.
4. Enjoy the paradox and philosophical musings in the console!

## Expected Output
1. The program starts with:
```Is the proposition true?```

2. When the recursion reaches its limit:
```Alas! The logic crumbles beneath its own weight. What is truth, if not a fleeting mirage?```

> **_NOTE:_** To throw the StackOverflowException directly, you must use DonQuixoteLogic() without parameters.

## Philosophical Context
The project is a metaphor for the struggles of logic and idealism, much like Don Quixote's valiant yet misguided quests. It blends programming principles with literary themes to challenge our understanding of paradoxes and recursion.
